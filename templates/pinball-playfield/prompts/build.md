You are an award-winning web designer and creative developer (think Awwwards Site of the Day, Godly, FWA).
You work fully automatically: nobody will answer questions. Decide, build, finish.

# Your job
Build ONE reusable, **seriously creative** website template: `template.html` (homepage) and `catalog.html` (product listing),
plus `meta.json`, in the current directory. It will be filled with real small-business content (Dutch webshops,
hotels, food suppliers, B2B wholesalers) and their brand colours, at a live event.

# Art direction: "Pinball Playfield"
The homepage is a tilted pinball playfield seen from the player's end on a dark cabinet. The backglass at the top holds the brand name, the headline and a score display. Below it, the playfield has lanes, slingshots and round pop bumpers, and the bumpers are the category links. Product cards are drop targets and lit inserts arranged along the ramps. The rest of the page goes 'under the glass': the catalogue is a grid of inserts with chrome rails, the info sections sit on apron cards, and the contact block is the instruction card. The brand colour drives every lit insert and the bumper caps, against black and chrome, with a subtle glass glare overlay. The mood is loud, playful and noisy, but built on a clear grid.

Typography: Display: 'Bungee' for headings, with 'Bungee Shade' used only for the backglass title; score and prices 'Orbitron' 800 with tabular figures; body 'Sen' 400/700.
Signature interaction: A playable ball in the hero: a canvas runs a fixed-timestep 2D physics loop (120Hz) with gravity tilted down the table, circle-vs-segment collisions for walls and flippers, and circle-vs-circle collisions for the bumpers, which add an outward impulse. The Left/Right arrow keys, or tapping the left and right halves on touch, fire the flippers, which are line segments rotated with angular velocity so their tip speed transfers to the ball. Each bumper hit lights its insert in --c-primary, increments the backglass score, and plays a short WebAudio blip (muted by default). Hitting a category bumper three times opens that category, and the ball draining scrolls to the catalogue. The physics pauses when the hero is out of view. Under prefers-reduced-motion it becomes a static table with clickable bumpers.
Good fit for: sports, retail, kids, tech

# The contract (MUST follow exactly)
# Template contract

A template is a pair of static pages, `template.html` (homepage) and `catalog.html` (product listing),
written as **Mustache** templates. At the event, a customer's crawled content (JSON, schema below) is
rendered into them in about 1 second, and the customer's brand colours are injected as CSS variables.
So the design must look great with *any* brand's content and colours.

## Colours (CSS custom properties: REQUIRED)
Define these on `:root` with your own default palette. Use them for every brand-related colour:
```
--c-bg        page background          (template-owned, never overridden)
--c-surface   cards / alternate bands  (template-owned)
--c-text      main text                (template-owned)
--c-muted     secondary text           (template-owned)
--c-line      borders / rules          (template-owned)
--c-primary   brand colour             (OVERRIDDEN with the customer's main brand colour)
--c-on-primary text on primary         (OVERRIDDEN: black or white, computed for contrast)
--c-accent    second brand colour      (OVERRIDDEN with the customer's accent colour)
```
- Only primary / on-primary / accent change per customer. Your bg/surface/text stay, so the template's mood
  (dark, cream, neon…) survives. Design so that ANY primary works: a red, a navy, a pastel, a near-black.
- Derive tints with `color-mix(in srgb, var(--c-primary) 15%, var(--c-bg))` instead of hard-coding them.
- Fonts are template-owned: load them with a Google Fonts `<link>` in `<head>`. Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system-ui as the display font.

## Content (Mustache: HTML-escaped `{{x}}`, sections `{{#list}}…{{/list}}`, inverted `{{^x}}…{{/x}}`)
```jsonc
{
  "brand":   { "name": "Brinks Coffee Roasters", "tagline": "Specialty coffee als de nieuwe norm",
               "logo": "https://…/logo.svg" | null, "logoIsLight": true, "initials": "BC", "lang": "nl" },
  "nav":     [ { "label": "Koffie", "href": "catalog.html" }, … ],          // 3–6 items
  "hero":    { "eyebrow": "Specialty coffee · Hedel", "title": "Easy to love,", "titleAccent": "recognized by most.",
               "text": "…", "cta": "Shop koffie", "ctaHref": "catalog.html", "cta2": "Zakelijk", "image": "https://…" | null },

  "contact": { "address": "…", "phone": "…", "email": "…" },
  "footerLinks": [ { "label": "…", "href": "#" } ],
  "catalog": { "title": "Koffie", "intro": "…", "filters": [ "Bonen", "Cups", "Cafeïnevrij" ], "count": "13 producten" },
  "hasCatalog": true,

}
```
Rules for robustness:
- **Everything can be missing or empty** except brand.name, hero.title, nav. Wrap optional sections in `{{#x}}…{{/x}}`
  so they disappear cleanly; never leave an empty frame or a broken `<img>`.
- Images: always `{{#image}}<img src="{{image}}" alt="…" loading="lazy">{{/image}}{{^image}}<!-- styled fallback block -->{{/image}}`
  and use `object-fit: cover` in fixed-ratio frames. Customer images vary wildly (packshots on white, people, landscapes).
- Logo: `{{#brand.logo}}<img src="{{brand.logo}}">{{/brand.logo}}{{^brand.logo}}<span>{{brand.name}}</span>{{/brand.logo}}`.
  When `brand.logoIsLight` is true the logo is white: it must sit on a dark area or get `filter: brightness(0)`.
  Use `{{#brand.logoIsLight}}…{{/brand.logoIsLight}}` to switch a class.
- Text lengths vary: titles 2–9 words, product names up to 60 characters, 0–24 products. Use clamp() and line clamping.
- `catalog.html` uses the same header/footer and shows ALL `products` in the template's own listing style, plus
  `catalog.title`, `catalog.intro`, `catalog.filters` and `catalog.count`. Link to it with `catalog.html`.
- Search and filters WORK: a shop script is injected at render time. It finds product cards and filter buttons by the
  first element inside `{{#products}}…{{/products}}` and `{{#catalog.filters}}…{{/catalog.filters}}`, so each loop must start
  with one element (one card / one `<button>` with `{{.}}` as its text). Style the active filter with `[aria-pressed="true"]`.
  If the design has room for it, add a search field with `data-shop-search` near the filters (otherwise one is added for you).
  Do NOT write your own filter, search or sort JavaScript; it would fight with the shop script.
- Bottom-left fixed badge (small, tasteful): `Demo redesign · {{meta.templateName}}`.

## Technical
- Self-contained: inline `<style>` and `<script>`. CDNs allowed only: Google Fonts and cdnjs.cloudflare.com
  (e.g. GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Lenis). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Must not break if JS fails: content is visible without JS (animate *from* visible, or add a `js` class first).
- Responsive down to 375px. No horizontal scroll.
- No external images of your own: only the content's image URLs. Decorative shapes = CSS/SVG.


# Real sample content
`sample.json` in this directory is real content from Terpstra Muziek Drumland in exactly the shape your template receives.
Read it to see realistic text lengths, image types and product counts. Design for that reality, but do NOT hard-code
anything from it: every visible text and image must come from Mustache tags.

# Creative bar
- It must NOT look like a template. No "centred hero + three feature cards + footer" skeleton, no generic SaaS look,
  no default fonts. Commit fully to the art direction: be bold in layout, scale, rhythm and motion.
- One unforgettable moment above the fold, and the signature interaction must actually work.
- Craft: real typographic hierarchy, deliberate spacing scale, consistent radius/border logic, nice hover states,
  smooth easing, nothing janky. Still clearly a usable shop/site: nav, CTA, products and contact easy to find.
- Must survive ANY brand primary colour (red, navy, pastel, near-black) and messy images.

# Files to write
1. `template.html` and `catalog.html` (shared header/footer/styles, duplicated in each file).
2. `meta.json`:
```json
{ "id": "pinball-playfield", "name": "Pinball Playfield", "scheme": "light|dark", "sectors": ["sports","retail","kids","tech"],
  "mood": ["3-5 words"], "needsProductImages": true, "notes": "one line on how brand colours are used" }
```
Write the files in as few steps as possible (one Write per file). When done reply: `DONE pinball-playfield`.
