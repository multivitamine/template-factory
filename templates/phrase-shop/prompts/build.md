You are an award-winning web designer and creative developer (think Awwwards Site of the Day, Godly, FWA).
You work fully automatically: nobody will answer questions. Decide, build, finish.

# Your job
Build ONE reusable, **seriously creative** website template: `template.html` (homepage) and `catalog.html` (product listing),
plus `meta.json`, in the current directory. It will be filled with real small-business content (Dutch webshops,
hotels, food suppliers, B2B wholesalers) and their brand colours, at a live event.

# Art direction: "Phrase Shop"
A warm cream page (#F6F0E6) with deep ink-brown type, large serif headlines and calm editorial spacing, where --c-primary marks the changeable words, the cart and buttons. The hero is one large sentence that doubles as the shop's entrance, for example 'Ik zoek [alles] voor [iedereen] onder [€ 50]', with each bracketed word underlined and interactive, followed by a shop CTA that reads the sentence's result count ('Bekijk 24 producten'). Homepage products sit in an asymmetric 2+3 editorial grid with the first product large, photos contained on a soft tinted pad with a thin rule frame, serif names, italic prices and a quick add. The catalog repeats the sentence as its sticky header and the grid updates as words change, with a matching count and a gentle crossfade. The mood is warm, literate and inviting, like being helped by a good shop assistant.

Typography: Display: 'Brygada 1918' 500 at large sizes for the sentence and headlines, with italic for the changeable words and prices; body 'Hind' 400/500 at 15px for labels, cards and text.
Signature interaction: Rolling-word sentence filter. Each changeable word in the sentence is a button that opens an inline vertical roller in place: a column of options (the categories, audience words and price thresholds derived from the content) rendered in the same display italic, clipped to one line with a soft fade mask above and below. Wheel, vertical drag (with momentum and friction 0.92) or arrow keys roll the column, and it snaps to the nearest option with a spring (stiffness 260, damping 28). Neighbouring options tilt slightly away with rotateX and fade by distance, so it feels like a precise picker, not a dropdown. As the word changes, the surrounding sentence reflows smoothly: the width of the word slot animates between the measured widths of old and new word (FLIP on the slot), so the line never jumps. Each settled choice updates the filter state; the CTA count rolls to the new number and the product grid crossfades with a 40ms stagger. Enter or click outside closes the roller. The sentence state is written to the URL so it can be shared. Without JS each word is a native <select> styled as underlined text, and under prefers-reduced-motion the roller snaps without rotation or momentum.
Good fit for: food, retail, makers, services

# The contract (MUST follow exactly)
# Template contract

A template is a pair of static pages, `template.html` (homepage) and `catalog.html` (product listing),
written as **Mustache** templates. At the event, a customer's crawled content (JSON, schema below) is
rendered into them in about 1 second, and the customer's brand colours are injected as CSS variables.
So the design must look great with *any* brand's content and colours.

## Colours (CSS custom properties: REQUIRED)
Define these on `:root` with your own default palette. Use them for every brand-related colour:
```
--c-bg        page background          (template-owned, never overridden)
--c-surface   cards / alternate bands  (template-owned)
--c-text      main text                (template-owned)
--c-muted     secondary text           (template-owned)
--c-line      borders / rules          (template-owned)
--c-primary   brand colour             (OVERRIDDEN with the customer's main brand colour)
--c-on-primary text on primary         (OVERRIDDEN: black or white, computed for contrast)
--c-accent    second brand colour      (OVERRIDDEN with the customer's accent colour)
```
- Only primary / on-primary / accent change per customer. Your bg/surface/text stay, so the template's mood
  (dark, cream, neon…) survives. Design so that ANY primary works: a red, a navy, a pastel, a near-black.
- Derive tints with `color-mix(in srgb, var(--c-primary) 15%, var(--c-bg))` instead of hard-coding them.
- Fonts are template-owned: load them with a Google Fonts `<link>` in `<head>`. Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system-ui as the display font.

## Content (Mustache: HTML-escaped `{{x}}`, sections `{{#list}}…{{/list}}`, inverted `{{^x}}…{{/x}}`)
```jsonc

  "brand":   { "name": "Brinks Coffee Roasters", "tagline": "Specialty coffee als de nieuwe norm",

  "nav":     [ { "label": "Koffie", "href": "catalog.html" }, … ],          // 3–6 items
  "hero":    { "eyebrow": "Specialty coffee · Hedel", "title": "Easy to love,", "titleAccent": "recognized by most.",
               "text": "…", "cta": "Shop koffie", "ctaHref": "catalog.html", "cta2": "Zakelijk", "image": "https://…" | null },

  "contact": { "address": "…", "phone": "…", "email": "…" },
  "footerLinks": [ { "label": "…", "href": "#" } ],
  "catalog": { "title": "Koffie", "intro": "…", "filters": [ "Bonen", "Cups", "Cafeïnevrij" ], "count": "13 producten" },
  "hasCatalog": true,

}
```
Rules for robustness:
- **Everything can be missing or empty** except brand.name, hero.title, nav. Wrap optional sections in `{{#x}}…{{/x}}`
  so they disappear cleanly; never leave an empty frame or a broken `<img>`.
- Images: always `{{#image}}<img src="{{image}}" alt="…" loading="lazy">{{/image}}{{^image}}<!-- styled fallback block -->{{/image}}`
  and use `object-fit: cover` in fixed-ratio frames. Customer images vary wildly (packshots on white, people, landscapes).
- Logo: `{{#brand.logo}}<img src="{{brand.logo}}">{{/brand.logo}}{{^brand.logo}}<span>{{brand.name}}</span>{{/brand.logo}}`.
  When `brand.logoIsLight` is true the logo is white: it must sit on a dark area or get `filter: brightness(0)`.
  Use `{{#brand.logoIsLight}}…{{/brand.logoIsLight}}` to switch a class.
- Text lengths vary: titles 2–9 words, product names up to 60 characters, 0–24 products. Use clamp() and line clamping.
- `catalog.html` uses the same header/footer and shows ALL `products` in the template's own listing style, plus
  `catalog.title`, `catalog.intro`, `catalog.filters` and `catalog.count`. Link to it with `catalog.html`.
- Search and filters WORK: a shop script is injected at render time. It finds product cards and filter buttons by the
  first element inside `{{#products}}…{{/products}}` and `{{#catalog.filters}}…{{/catalog.filters}}`, so each loop must start
  with one element (one card / one `<button>` with `{{.}}` as its text). Style the active filter with `[aria-pressed="true"]`.
  If the design has room for it, add a search field with `data-shop-search` near the filters (otherwise one is added for you).
  Do NOT write your own filter, search or sort JavaScript; it would fight with the shop script.
- Bottom-left fixed badge (small, tasteful): `Demo redesign · {{meta.templateName}}`.

## Technical
- Self-contained: inline `<style>` and `<script>`. CDNs allowed only: Google Fonts and cdnjs.cloudflare.com
  (e.g. GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Lenis). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Must not break if JS fails: content is visible without JS (animate *from* visible, or add a `js` class first).
- Responsive down to 375px. No horizontal scroll.
- No external images of your own: only the content's image URLs. Decorative shapes = CSS/SVG.


# Real sample content
`sample.json` in this directory is real content from Spaansen in exactly the shape your template receives.
Read it to see realistic text lengths, image types and product counts. Design for that reality, but do NOT hard-code
anything from it: every visible text and image must come from Mustache tags.

# Creative bar
- It must NOT look like a template. No "centred hero + three feature cards + footer" skeleton, no generic SaaS look,
  no default fonts. Commit fully to the art direction: be bold in layout, scale, rhythm and motion.
- One unforgettable moment above the fold, and the signature interaction must actually work.
- Craft: real typographic hierarchy, deliberate spacing scale, consistent radius/border logic, nice hover states,
  smooth easing, nothing janky. Still clearly a usable shop/site: nav, CTA, products and contact easy to find.
- Must survive ANY brand primary colour (red, navy, pastel, near-black) and messy images.

# This is a premium online shop (e-commerce focus)
- Benchmark: the best-crafted webshops on Awwwards / Godly today. Modern, digital-native, refined. No themed metaphor,
  no costume, no retro pastiche: the impact comes from layout, typography, motion and finish.
- Products are the hero of the page: a shoppable product moment above or right after the fold, real prices, quick
  add-to-cart with visible cart feedback (count bump, drawer or toast), and a catalog with filtering/sorting that animates.
- Frame imperfect product photos so they look art-directed (consistent aspect, tinted backdrops, object-fit, masks).
- Motion is smooth and purposeful: eased (no linear), interruptible, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Details that separate Site of the Day from a template: considered hover states, magnetic or cursor-aware touches,
  fluid type scale (clamp), tight optical spacing, crisp hairlines, a memorable footer.

# Files to write
1. `template.html` and `catalog.html` (shared header/footer/styles, duplicated in each file).
2. `meta.json`:
```json
{ "id": "phrase-shop", "name": "Phrase Shop", "scheme": "light|dark", "sectors": ["food","retail","makers","services"],
  "mood": ["3-5 words"], "needsProductImages": true, "notes": "one line on how brand colours are used" }
```
Write the files in as few steps as possible (one Write per file). When done reply: `DONE phrase-shop`.
